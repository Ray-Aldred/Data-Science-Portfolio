# Ray Aldred's Data Science Portfolio and Projects

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! This collection of projects represents my skills and knowledge in data science using Python, including data wrangling, visualization, machine learning, and statistical analysis. The projects are a culmination of my experience in working with various datasets and applying different techniques to solve real-world problems.

In this portfolio, you will find a variety of projects that showcase my ability to extract meaningful insights from data, build predictive models, and communicate results effectively using Python. I have included a range of projects, from exploratory data analysis to machine learning models.

I have used various Python libraries and frameworks, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. I have also worked with a variety of datasets, and there is more coming as I learn!

I hope that my Data Science Portfolio will not only demonstrate my technical skills but also highlight my ability to think critically, problem-solve, and communicate effectively using Python. I am excited to share my work with you and look forward to any feedback or suggestions you may have.

## 1. [A Visual History of the Nobel Prize Winners](https://github.com/Ray-Aldred/A-Visual-History-of-Nobel-Prize-Winners/blob/main/notebook.ipynb)

The Nobel Prize, an esteemed accolade recognized globally, serves to acknowledge the accomplishments of preeminent scholars and scientists in the fields of chemistry, literature, physics, medicine, economics, and peace. Since its inception in 1901, the award has evolved from its initial Eurocentric and male-dominated disposition to a more equitable and unbiased recognition of excellence.

To scrutinize the nature of this prestigious honor, one may pose several inquiries: What attributes are shared amongst laureates? Which nation boasts the highest frequency of recipients? And have any individuals been distinguished with multiple Nobel Prizes? The onus of answering these questions falls upon the inquisitive mind.

For this analysis, data has been procured from the Nobel Foundation's [repository](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nobelfoundation/nobel-laureates) on the Kaggle platform.

## 2. [Harold Potter Wordcloudes](https://github.com/Ray-Aldred/Kaggle-Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/harold-potter-wordclouds.ipynb)

Word Clouds represent an elegant visualization methodology employed primarily for the display of prominent tags or keywords derived from a given textual corpus or website. These keywords typically encapsulate the essence of the subject matter or thematic context within the text or site in question. In this analytical notebook, I shall endeavor to generate a word cloud encompassing all seven volumes of the esteemed literary series, Harry Potter.

## 3. [Predicting Credit Card Approvals](https://github.com/Ray-Aldred/Predicting-Credit-Card-Approvals/blob/main/notebook.ipynb)

Commercial banking institutions are inundated with a plethora of credit card applications, a substantial portion of which are ultimately rejected due to various factors, such as elevated loan balances, inadequate income levels, or an excessive number of inquiries on an individual's credit report, to name but a few. The manual analysis of these applications proves to be a laborious, error-prone, and time-consuming endeavor, with time being an invaluable commodity. Fortuitously, the advent of machine learning has enabled the automation of this process, a strategy now ubiquitously employed by contemporary commercial banks. In this project, you shall undertake the construction of an automated credit card approval predictor, harnessing the power of machine learning techniques, thereby emulating the methodologies employed by real-world banking institutions.

For this endeavor, the dataset utilized shall be the [Credit Card Approval dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval), sourced from the esteemed UCI Machine Learning Repository.
