# Ray Aldred's Data Science Portfolio and Projects

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! This collection of projects represents my skills and knowledge in data science using Python, including data wrangling, visualization, machine learning, and statistical analysis. The projects are a culmination of my experience in working with various datasets and applying different techniques to solve real-world problems.

In this portfolio, you will find a variety of projects that showcase my ability to extract meaningful insights from data, build predictive models, and communicate results effectively using Python. I have included a range of projects, from exploratory data analysis to machine learning models.

I have used various Python libraries and frameworks, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. I have also worked with a variety of datasets, and there is more coming up as I learn!

I hope that my Data Science Portfolio will not only demonstrate my technical skills but also highlight my ability to think critically, problem-solve, and communicate effectively using Python. I am excited to share my work with you and look forward to any feedback or suggestions you may have.

## 1. [A Visual History of the Nobel Prize Winners](https://github.com/Ray-Aldred/A-Visual-History-of-Nobel-Prize-Winners/blob/main/notebook.ipynb)

The Nobel Prize, an esteemed accolade recognized globally, serves to acknowledge the accomplishments of preeminent scholars and scientists in the fields of chemistry, literature, physics, medicine, economics, and peace. Since its inception in 1901, the award has evolved from its initial Eurocentric and male-dominated disposition to a more equitable and unbiased recognition of excellence.

To scrutinize the nature of this prestigious honor, one may pose several inquiries: What attributes are shared amongst laureates? Which nation boasts the highest frequency of recipients? And have any individuals been distinguished with multiple Nobel Prizes? The onus of answering these questions falls upon the inquisitive mind.

For this analysis, data has been procured from the Nobel Foundation's repository on the Kaggle platform.
